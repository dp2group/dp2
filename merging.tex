\section{Merging}

When two users merge, the user with the higher \emph{uid} is selected to be
the merger. All merging is done on a pairwise basis. If n users are online 
and another comes online, the user with the highest \emph{uid} out of the currently
online group is chosen to do a pairwise merge with the newcomer.

When this happens, the user with the lower \emph{uid} (user A) looks up the last merge point
with the higher \emph{uid} (user B), and sends everything in his log past that point to
A. User B also scans back in the log to the last merge with 

%User B then locks his document and creates a temporary copy somewhere else in memory (the
%working copy).

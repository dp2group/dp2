\section{Conclusion}
This design solves many of the technical problems associated with a peer-to-peer
collaborative text editor. The document is represented in memory in a tree-like structure
that allows users to make changes to the document structure at paragraph and sentence
granularity, simplifying the merging process. The modified version vector allows these
changes to be communicated without transferring the entire document between users. Once
conflicts are detected, the merge process described above allows the conflicts to be
resolved and distributed back to the users. Commit points similarly handled by ensuring
that the document is agreed upon by every user, merging different versions as necessary,
before saving the file. Together, these mechanisms comprise a system that allows user-friendly
editing of shared text files, even without network connection.

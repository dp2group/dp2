\section{Introduction}
CVS, named for its creators Cooper, Vatterott, and Stueck, is a peer to peer text editor.  The system is designed to operate in a distributed network where all users are not necessarily always connected, and where no central server is used to host the developing document.  CVS is designed, in particular, for situations where users connect their laptops to each other, but may not necessarily all be connected at the same time, and may never connect over the internet.  CVS employs a set of clever safety mechanisms and data storage techniques to ensure that all users can seamlessly operate on a document without doing unnecessary work.

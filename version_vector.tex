\section{Version Vector}
A document's version information is represented in a modified version vector
maintained by each user. Each paragraph in the document is assigned a unique
paragraph id. The vector contains (paragraph id, version number)
pairs, ordered so that each paragraph occurs in the vector in the order it occurs
in the document. Every time a user merges his changes with another user, both save
the vector they have agreed upon.

$$
 [ (pid, version), (pid, version), (pid, version) ]
$$

This allows the system to track changes to individual paragraphs as well as changes
to the order of paragraphs. If for example, in a document with three paragraphs, 
A moves paragraph 1 to the end, and B changes a word in paragraph 1, their vectors
will change from:

$$ 
 A, B: [ (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0) ]
$$

to:

$$
 A: [ (2, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0) ] $$ $$ 
 B: [ (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0) ]
$$

upon merging, both users will see that the vectors are different than the last
agreed upon vector, and the merging process will occur. Because of how the vector
is structured, only the text from one paragraph needs to be transmitted between 
hosts, the order information can be transmitted using a more concise protocol.

\section{Conclusion}

CVS successfully handles all requirements and scenarios posed in the Design Project 2.  CVS does this with limited space and runtime resources, which make the system an excellent option for users looking for a quality peer to peer collaborative document editing system.  The system does have some limitations, as noted in the design and analysis, but these limitations are extreme edge cases and are unlikely to ever affect the actual user.  Moving forward, we would like to open source CVS, which will allow users to optimize the system for their own needs and will allow the most users possible to benefit from CVS.
